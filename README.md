# resnet_pytorch
Identifying defects in solar cells with neural networks

In this project, I am training a resnet architecture implemented using pytorch to detect defects in solar-cells. The architecture can be found in model.py file and hyperparameters can be adjusted in the train.py file. In the current state an f1 score of 0.8 is reached.
